    <h1>Games</h1>
    <p>Since Puyo Puyo has existed since 1991 (over 30 years!), there are countless games and spin-offs that feature the Puyo Puyo characters or puzzle game. Below are a few major releases
      from the main series, many of which have never been released outside of Japan.</p>
    <div class="white-box">
      <h2>Compile Era</h2>
      <p>
        Compile was a Japanese game developer studio founded in 1982. It had released many games, but Puyo Puyo was its first big success. 
        The developers ended up creating more Puyo Puyo games to capitalize on its success, but the company eventually ran out of money.
        After selling the rights to Puyo Puyo to SEGA, Compile filed for bankruptcy in 2003. One of its main successors is Compile Heart,
        which created a new Madou Monogatari game (without the Puyo Puyo characters).

        </div>
          
        <div>
          <h3>Madou Monogatari 1-2-3 (1990)</h3>
          <p>A first-person dungeon crawler with voice acting and a unique health/damage system, in which HP was portrayed by the expression of the main character rather 
          than a number or bar. This was the game in which the first Puyo Puyo characters were introduced.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h3>Puyo Puyo (1991)</h3>
          <p>The first game featuring the Puyo Puyo puzzle game. The characters came from the Madou Monogatari series, but the story
             was slightly different. The Puyo Puyo series as a whole is much more lighthearted, and over time, the characters 
            eventually deviated far from their original personalities in Madou Monogatari.

        <div>
          <h3>Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (1993)/Kirby's Avalanche (1995)</h3>
          <p>These games were English localized versions of Puyo Puyo, featuring Sonic or Kirby characters rather than Madou Monogatari characters. The gameplay was 
          the same, though. They are beloved by fans who may not even know who the original Puyo Puyo characters are!</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Puyo Puyo Tsu (1994)</h3>
          <p>The second game in the Puyo Puyo series, which introduced a few new mechanics to the game. The player plays as Arle, 
            who climbs a tower that has an opponent on each floor.

        <div>
          <h3>Puyo Puyo Sun (1996)</h3>
          <p>The third game in the series (Sun sounds like three in Japanese). It introduced the game-specific Sun Puyo. The plot follows Draco, Arle, and Schezo 
          as they try to find Satan and defeat him after he enlarges the sun.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Puyo Puyo~n (1999)</h3>
          <p>The last game in the main series developed by Compile. The art style is more muted and serious than Puyo Puyo Sun, which had a tropical theme. In the 
          story mode of the game, Arle searches for Carbuncle after he disappears in a circus act, only to uncover more mysteries.</p>

    <div class="white-box">
      <h2>SEGA Era</h2>
      <p>The Puyo Puyo series was bought by SEGA around 1998 because Compile had gone into debt. SEGA and the Sonic Team began developing new Puyo Puyo games in around 2001.
        These games featured new characters and a drastically different art style and story. SEGA creates Puyo Puyo games to this day, and it
        remains a popular franchise in Japan.

        <div>
          <h3>Puyo Puyo Fever (2003)</h3>
          <p>This was the first Puyo Puyo game developed and published by SEGA. It was also the first Puyo Puyo game to have online battles with random matching. The 
          story follows a new character, Amitie, as she searches for her teacher's lost magic cane.</p>

          <p>A popular mobile puzzle RPG spinoff of Puyo Puyo that uses a card system with skills. It has its own story and introduced many, many characters exclusive to the game. 
          It sometimes does crossovers with other franchises.</p>
