    <h1>Characters</h1>
    <p>Puyo Puyo has a large cast of characters that have changed drastically, at least in terms of design, over the years. Many of them were created after SEGA 
      obtained the franchise, so they come from several different universes that occasionally collide and lead to interactions between characters from them. 
      Below are the unofficial main characters of the series (at the moment), as well as a few secondary characters. </p>
    
      <div class="white-box">
      
      <img src="images/arle.png" class="image-float" alt="Arle" title="Arle Nadja">
      <h2>Arle</h2>
      <p>Arle is a cheerful, adventurous, tomboyish girl who is rarely seen without her companion, Carbuncle. She is also somewhat levelheaded, often 
        being the voice reason when around the other more eccentric characters. Arle, Amitie, and Ringo are usually seen together as the "main characters" of 
        the Puyo Puyo series, and they are the protagonists of the games that take place in their respective universes. </p> <br class="clear">
      
      <img src="images/amitie.png" class="image-float" alt="Amitie" title="Amitie">
      <h2>Amitie</h2>
      <p>Amitie is a bubbly, friendly girl who attends a magic school in Primp Town. She is forgiving and optimistic, to the point where she could
        be considered naive. Amitie was the main character of the first Puyo Puyo game created by the Sonic Team and SEGA, marking a new era of the franchise. </p> <br class="clear">
      
      <img src="images/ringo.png" class="image-float" alt="Ringo" title="Ringo Ando">
      <h2>Ringo</h2>
      <p>Ringo comes from a universe where Puyo do not exist. She thinks very logically, loves science and math, and is curious about learning about everything 
        around her. Ringo generally has a positive disposition, but she dislikes when something can't be explained scientifically. Ringo often carries an apple with 
        her (Ringo means apple in Japanese).</p> <br class="clear">
      
      <img src="images/schezo.png" class="image-float" alt="Schezo" title="Schezo Wegey">
      <h2>Schezo</h2>
      <p>Schezo is a dark mage who fights with a crystal sword. He is standoffish, blunt, and apathetic, which makes him uncomfortable to be around for some. He 
        avoids the company of other people, prefering to live in isolation in dark places like caves. This may have worsened his social skills, as he tends to
        fumble his words, be socially unaware, and say things that give off the wrong impression. </p> <br class="clear">
      
      <img src="images/rulue.png" class="image-float" alt="Rulue" title="Rulue">
      <h2>Rulue</h2>
      <p>Rulue is confident and assertive, but she is also very prideful and loses composure when she feels insulted or things don't go as she wants. Although 
        she does not use magic, Rulue is a very powerful martial artist. Rulue works for Satan and is madly in love with him, although he does not reciprocate 
        her feelings. </p> <br class="clear">
      
      <img src="images/satan.png" class="image-float" alt="Satan" title="Satan">
      <h2>Satan</h2>
      <p>Satan is the ruler of the Puyo underworld. In English localizations, he is referred to as the Dark Prince. Satan was the previous owner of Carbuncle, whom
        he planned to give to his future fiance. One of Satan's main goals is to marry Arle, who took Carbuncle from him. Satan usually doesn't do anything evil; 
        if anything, he acts immaturely. He is often found creating flashy plans to impress Arle (such as making a giant castle or <a href="https://youtu.be/rAx8ACxHhJk" target="_blank">enlarging the sun to get a cool tan</a>),
        but they never work and usually cause problems for others, who have to go stop him.  </p>
